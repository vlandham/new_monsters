# The Something

Something moving.  
There, in the dark.

The Something.  
Out here,  
with us.  
In the dark.  

What Something?

THE SOMETHING

Now, stay still.  
The Something  
is moving.  

Perhaps,  
its already  
had its fill.  

The Something  
is moving on.  
I think, I think,  
we are safe.  

OH NO, WATCH OUT!  
RUN!  
NO! IT'S TOO LATE!
