# The Something

Something moving.  
There, in the dark.

The Something.  
Out here,  
With us.  
In the dark.  

What Something?

**THE SOMETHING**

Now, stay still.  
The Something  
Is moving.  

Perhaps,  
Its already  
Had its fill.  

The Something  
Is moving on.  
I think, I think,  
We are safe.  

OH NO, WATCH OUT!  
RUN!  
NO! IT'S TOO LATE!
