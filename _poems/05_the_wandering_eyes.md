# The Wandering Eyes

The Wandering Eyes fly through the air.  
Going from place to place.

Looking, seeking, searching,  
For a home to call a face.

They never stop for long,  
For every face they've spied,

Is already filled,  
Unfortunately occupied.

So on they float, two eyes on the breeze.  
Going from town to town.

Talking to each other with blinks and winks,  
Never making a sound.

Climb up a hill and close your eyes  
On some windy night.

And the Wandering Eyes might land on you,  
And give you quite a fright.
