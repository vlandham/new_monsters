# The Doppel

Out on adventures, through the hills and trees you roam.
As dusk approaches, you make your way toward home.

Ahead on the road, a figure now stands,
It has your hair, your shoulders, even your hands.

This stranger is like you in every way but one,
Where you have your face, this thing has none.

You move forward, determined to not show your fear,
And this is when things get even stranger my dear.

Each step you take forward, your twin takes one back.
Like a shadow, as you press on, it just retracts.

Trying to be brave, you walk steadily on,
but you start to know that something is wrong.

You look again at the twin, and now you see,
a twisted smile, where no smile used to be.

You stop for a moment to raise up a shout,
but find that nothing comes out of your mouth.

For now, with no one else to witness,
You are the twin who has become the lipless.

You start to jog, and the thing jogs too.
Still moving backwards, and facing toward you.

You are doing your best to stay composed,
but now you see it has gotten your nose!

You move faster, your home now in your gaze.
But suddenly, your eyesight starts to haze.

Looking at that awful thing up ahead,
You can see your eyes start to appear on its head.

Panicked and distraught, you break into full run.
Your vision darkens like the setting sun.

The figure too picks up its pace,
Eyes forming faster on its terrible face.

Now you understand fully your plight,
And it fills you with unmeasured fright.

If you are not the first to touch the handle of your door,
The Doppel will have your face now and forevermore.

And it will be free to wander with your smile and sight,
While you stay lost in a never ending night.

With all your energy you give one last burst,
Is it you or the Doppel who reaches the door first?
