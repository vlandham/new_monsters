# A Spell to Disappear Forever

_Ingredients:_

The wart of a toad  
The hair of a dog  
The bumps of a road  
The wet of a fog


A thimble of dew  
A cup-full of dust  
A half pint of ***  
A bushel of rust

_Instructions:_

On a dark that is not night,  
Before the first hour is past,  
Mix this potion up right,  
Then say this spell to cast:  

Wind in the trees,  
And wind in my lungs.

Join with the breeze,  
Become all in one.
