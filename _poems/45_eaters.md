# The Eater

I was upstairs playing in my room.  
It was a normal gloomy afternoon.

From down the stairs, came a strange sound.  
That started quiet, but soon grew loud.

A rasping, a scraping, a chewing.  
I thought, what down there is my family doing?

I was concerned, so downstairs I went.  
The noise was coming from the basement.

Down there I found the source of the sound.  
It wasn't my family, they weren't even around.

Instead a huge head, like nothing I've seen.  
Was chomping away at our washing machine!

The head was made of steel and dust.  
It was ten feet tall and covered in rust.

With metal teeth and a powerful jaw.  
Just floating as it munched - no body at all.

It finished the washer with one last chew.  
And bit into the dryer, with hunger anew.

I must say, it was quite an eater.  
After the dryer, it ate the water heater.

As it ate appliances, it gained in size.  
Till it was over twenty feet high.

I grabbed at its back to make the eating stop.  
But was dragged along as it floated up.

Breaking through the old basement door.  
It came to the kitchen and still wanted more.

**ToDO**

It went through the house eating metal and trash.  
Then went through the rooftop with a terrible smash.

I rode the massive thing out like a fool.
It was now the size of a large swimming pool.

It floated to our neighbor's home, Catlin Grunch.  
And bit right in with a  terrible crunch.

In three quick bites, it was on to the next.  
The house of my friend, Petey Pemtreck.

In half an hour, I was shocked as I stood.  
The eater had eaten half the neighborhood.

This is when **TODO**

I woke up in the arms of my mother.  
She was alive! I got up and hugged her.

But the eater had been busy as I was asleep.  
There wasn't a house that it did not keep.

I looked all around, it ate even the cars.  
Well, good thing I like sleeping under the stars.
