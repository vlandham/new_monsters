I was upstairs playing in my room.  
It was a normal gloomy afternoon.

From down the stairs, came a strange sound.  
That started quiet, but soon grew loud.

A rasping, a scraping, a chewing.  
I thought, what down there is my family doing?

I was concerned, so downstairs I went.  
The noise was coming from the basement.

Down there I found the source of the sound.  
It wasn't my family, they weren't even around.

Instead a huge head, like nothing I've seen.  
Was chomping away at our washing machine!

The head was made of steel and dust.  
It was ten feet tall and covered in rust.

With metal teeth and a powerful jaw.  
Just floating as it munched - no body at all.
