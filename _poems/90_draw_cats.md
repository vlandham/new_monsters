# The Girl Who Drew Cats

_Inspired by a Japanese fairytale._

There once was a girl who loved to draw cats.  
From morning to midnight.  
Otherwise normal and alright.  
But always drawing those cats.

She drew cats at home and at school.  
On everything she laid eyes on.  
In oil and ink and crayon.  
So much so her classmates called her a fool.

One day she was caught by the teacher.  
Drawing cats on the wall.  
He told her, appalled,  
Detention that night should teach her.

That night she came back in time.  
Left in an empty room,  
To mop and dust and broom.  
To make up for her drawing crime.

Now this school was said to be cursed.  
At night something waiting,  
To catch anyone staying.  
To drink their blood and quench a terrible thirst.

Cleaning began with her full concentration.  
Till she noticed some chalk,  
And blackboard and thought,  
The room needed a new feline illustration.

Soon the board was filled with drawings.  
Of cats long and tall,  
Of cats short and small.  
Leaving the rest of the room quite appalling.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream gave her fright.  
From somewhere down the hall,  
She heard feet or paws.  
Shuffling closer in the dark night.

She had to hide not wanting to be found.  
Whatever the creature,  
It wasn't her teacher.  
No human made such a terrible sounds

Terrified by what might be in store,  
As her cats looked on,  
On her knees and palms,  
She crawled to the closet, closing the door.

Now the growling was right in the classroom.  
She heard it coming near,  
Her body froze with fear.  
Certainly this would be her final doom.

Another screech sounded, but this time of pain.  
The noise of an attack,  
Like the tear of a huge sack.  
Then silence filled the room once again.

It took a long time for her to peak out.  
The room was now bright,  
But destroyed by a fight.  
She opened the closet and stifled a shout.

There lumped on the floor was a huge rat beast.  
As big as a man.  
Cruel claws on each hand.  
But carved up like the turkey at a feast.

Looking up at the board now the cats all wore grins.  
The furry and fluffy,  
The sleek and scruffy.  
Were drawn with red blood down there chins.

Now the girl who loved to draw cats  
Can draw all she wants,  
With never a taunt.  
And the school is completely free of rats.
