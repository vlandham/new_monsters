# Benjamin Bies

Benjamin Bies, covered in flies  
He'll give you a lick  
Try to make you sick  
He's someone to truly despise.

Benjamin Bies, oh how he lies  
He'll give you first pick  
Of whats in his pocket  
The bite's a terrible surprise.

Benjamin Bies, he never dies  
He'll give you a prick  
With his scorpion stick  
With a laugh he's gone at sunrise.

Benjamin Bies, sits in disguise  
He'll look sweet and slick  
But don't fall for that trick  
He would love to be your demise.
