# A Spell to Walk on WaterA

_Ingredients:_

Fleece, grease,
A flock of geese.

Fleas, bees,
An old man's sneeze.

_Instructions:_

Come not hungry, but not fed.
Asleep, but without bed.
Come not naked, but with no clothes.
With a lantern that has no holes.

Come to the edge of a water with no name,
Give it one, and you will make it tame.
