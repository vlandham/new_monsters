# The Mud Monster

The darkening skies warn of impeding danger
With lightening and thunder announcing the stranger  
Darting about behind clouds holding back rain  
Waiting for just the right moment to appear once again  
Then, as the raindrops fall to the ground  
As if by magic the monster seems all around  
First a puddle or two where the ground is so bare  
Then like a lake or an ocean almost everywhere  
Ready to glob onto goulashes and boots  
To catch a ride as into homes we scoot  
Appearing from nowhere upon the kitchen floor  
Upon the throw rug leading by the front door  
Up the stairs it follows me now  
Into my room  
...Mud Monster how?  
How do you come so oozy and wet  
Find a good place to become hardened and set  
Show the whole world just where I've gone  
Through puddles and fields on my way home  
Oh, Mud Monster you're such a pain  
I'm glad you only come when it rains.
