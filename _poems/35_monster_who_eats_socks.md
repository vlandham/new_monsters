# The Monster Who Eats Socks

**By Dick Vallandingham**

In the back of your closet  
Where you may not look  
Behind your play clothes  
That fell from the hook  
In the darkest of corners  
In a forgotten shoe box  
Lives a tiny little creature--  
The monster who eats socks

It may eat just one  
Or it may eat a pair  
Sometimes just a toe  
Is all it will dare  
To ingest and digest  
For supper or lunch  
Or maybe a special  
Saturday brunch

So clever and sly  
So timid and shy  
As quick as a fox  
The monster who eats socks.
