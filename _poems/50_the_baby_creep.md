# Baby Creep


There's this thing that will creep while your babies asleep  
And it will slink right into their bed.

And quick as a wink. What are you baby still sleeps.  
This creep gobbles it up toes to head.

This will come with a surprise, but your babies quite fine.  
And will continue on sleeping soundly

While the creep stays in the crib under blankets and bib  
and starts to transform quite profoundly.

It's tail shrinks to a stub its beak A nose nub.  
Soft goes it's scaly lizard hide.

I know it sounds wild but it sure will look like your child.  
With the real baby still stuck inside.

With its new style the creep waits awhile.  
Making sure everything's perfect and neat.

And then it will cry out for you with a grin  
because to him a mother's a tasty treat.
