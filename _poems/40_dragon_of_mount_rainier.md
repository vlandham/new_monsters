# The Dragon of Mount Rainier

The last great dragon  
of the world  
Lives on Mount Rainier

And though it's slept  
a long long time  
It will soon wake, I fear

The dragon is long  
tall, and wide  
with tough scales, bright green

And every story  
I've heard of him  
say he is cruel and quite mean

The dragon, its said  
killed a thousand men  
and dragged them to his cave

Ate a hundred  
right then and there  
piled the rest of to save

**UNFINISHED**
