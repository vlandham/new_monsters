# Ghosts in my House

There is a ghost in my closet.  
Behind a box of toys.  
When playing, I close the door.  
As he doesn't like the noise.

There is a ghost in my chimney.  
She wails on windy nights.  
So I keep the fire burning.  
To show her everything's alright.

There is a ghost in my basement.  
Who hides in corners and nooks.  
She gets bored down there sometimes.  
So I leave her lots of books.

There is a ghost in the hallway.  
Who never comes out in day.  
At night, she taps my doorway.  
To ask if I can come out and play.

There is a ghost in my backyard.  
He climbs the tall pine tree.  
When I sit underneath it.  
He likes to sing with me.

There is a ghost in the attic.  
She doesn't make a peep.  
I tell her ghostly stories.  
Until she falls asleep.
