# A Toilet Monster

I've heard tale of a toilet monster,  
Shaped something like a snake.

It likes to slither in the water.  
It coils up and it waits.

It waits till you are right over,  
Covering the hole.

Its plan is to grab you,  
and drag you down below.

But don't worry, you are safe.  
Its plan never gets a start.

For its made of toilet paper,  
and soon it falls apart!
