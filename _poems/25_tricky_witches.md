# Tricky Witches

Tricky Witches dressed as cats.  
Lay in the sun on my door mat.

They stretch and purr, hiss and scratch.  
All the while, evil plans they hatch.

They want to steal me. Put me in a stew  
To make a special witches brew.

They are making magic to take away their old.  
Make them young, or so I'm told.

My parents don't have a clue  
of the terrible things they're up to.

My mother likes their soft fur.  
She pets them to here them purr.

My father likes when they catch mice.  
He thinks they're helpful, thinks they're nice.

They don't fool me, I have a bag.  
I'll capture up those two old hags.

Take them to the river and then,  
Well, you can guess how they will end.
