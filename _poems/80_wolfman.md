# Reverse Werewolf

The wolfman of Calcutti,  
Is something rather nutty.  
As you know, most werewolves rise with the moon.

But this Calcutti fellow,  
Howls and snarls and bellows,  
Right in the middle of the afternoon!

Yes, he's a bit confused,  
He should be out when we snooze.  
Instead his schedule is quite reversed.

And though he's brutish and hairy,  
It's hard to be all that scary,  
In full daylight - even if he's cursed.

**^ Fix**

Though he sneaks and hides in brambles,  
And is careful as he ambles,  
You can see him coming a mile away.

And so it's no surprise,  
When you see his yellow eyes.  
And give a shout: "The Wolfman's here today".

As Calcuttians, its our job,  
To scream and run, cower and sob.  
Pretending to be afraid of this fearsome foe.

But we stay one step ahead,  
So that no one ends up dead.  
We want to be safe with our job don't you know!

**^ Fix**

He leaves as night falls,  
Nothing ever caught in his jaws.  
But we think for him it's still a lot of fun.

And so we always hope,  
That our dear own lycanthrope,  
Will be back the very next new full-sun.
