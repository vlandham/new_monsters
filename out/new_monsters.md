# The Wandering Eyes

The Wandering Eyes fly through the air.  
Going from place to place.

Looking, seeking, searching,  
for a home to call a face.

They never stop for long,  
for every face they've spied,

Is already filled,  
unfortunately occupied.

So on they float, two eyes on the breeze.  
Going from town to town.

Talking to each other with blinks and winks,  
never making a sound.

Climb up a hill and close your eyes  
on some windy night.

And the Wandering Eyes might land on you,  
and give you quite a fright.

# The Something

Something moving.  
There, in the dark.

The Something.  
Out here,  
with us.  
In the dark.  

What Something?

THE SOMETHING

Now, stay still.  
The Something  
is moving.  

Perhaps,  
its already  
had its fill.  

The Something  
is moving on.  
I think, I think,  
we are safe.  

OH NO, WATCH OUT!  
RUN!  
OH, IT'S TOO LATE!
