# The Wandering Eyes

The Wandering Eyes fly through the air.  
Going from place to place.

Looking, seeking, searching,  
for a home to call a face.

They never stop for long,  
for every face they've spied,

Is already filled,  
unfortunately occupied.

So on they float, two eyes on the breeze.  
Going from town to town.

Talking to each other with blinks and winks,  
never making a sound.

Climb up a hill and close your eyes  
on some windy night.

And the Wandering Eyes might land on you,  
and give you quite a fright.

# The Something

Something moving.  
There, in the dark.

The Something.  
Out here,  
with us.  
In the dark.  

What Something?

THE SOMETHING

Now, stay still.  
The Something  
is moving.  

Perhaps,  
its already  
had its fill.  

The Something  
is moving on.  
I think, I think,  
we are safe.  

OH NO, WATCH OUT!  
RUN!  
NO! IT'S TOO LATE!

# A Toilet Monster

I've heard tale of a toilet monster,  
Shaped something like a snake.

It likes to slither in the water.  
It coils up and it waits.

It waits till you are right over,  
Covering the hole.

Its plan is to grab you,  
and drag you down below.

But don't worry, you are safe.  
Its plan never gets a start.

For its made of toilet paper,  
and soon it falls apart!

# Stick Creatures

Dry and brittle.  
Through mud they scuttle.

Always watchful.  
For kids to tackle.

These stick creatures.
Are blood thirsty.

Propped together.  
Easily scattered.

Kick them swiftly.  
They are no trouble.

Just a pester.  
Such clumsy monsters.

# Ghosts in my House

There is a ghost in my closet.  
Behind a box of toys.  
When playing, I close the door.  
As he doesn't like the noise.

There is a ghost in my chimney.  
She wails on windy nights.  
So I keep the fire burning.  
To show her everything's alright.

There is a ghost in my basement.  
Who hides in corners and nooks.  
She gets bored down there sometimes.  
So I leave her lots of books.

There is a ghost in the hallway.  
Who never comes out in day.  
At night, she taps my doorway.  
To ask if I can come out and play.

# Tricky Witches

Tricky Witches dressed as cats.  
Lay in the sun on my door mat.

They stretch and purr, hiss and scratch.  
All the while, evil plans they hatch.

They want to steal me. Put me in a stew  
To make a special witches brew.

They are making magic to take away their old.  
Make them young, or so I'm told.

My parents don't have a clue  
of the terrible things they're up to.

My mother likes their soft fur.  
She pets them to here them purr.

My father likes when they catch mice.  
He thinks they're helpful, thinks they're nice.

They don't fool me, I have a bag.  
I'll capture up those two old hags.

Take them to the river and then,  
Well, you can guess how they will end.

# Benjamin Bies

Benjamin Bies, covered in flies  
He'll give you a lick  
Try to make you sick  
He's someone to truly despise.

Benjamin Bies, oh how he lies  
He'll give you first pick  
Of whats in his pocket  
The bite's a terrible surprise.

Benjamin Bies, he never dies  
He'll give you a prick  
With his scorpion stick  
With a laugh he's gone at sunrise.

Benjamin Bies, sits in disguise  
He'll look sweet and slick  
But don't fall for that trick  
He would love to be your demise.

# The Monster Who Eats Socks

In the back of your closet  
Where you may not look  
Behind your play clothes  
That fell from the hook  
In the darkest of corners  
In a forgotten shoe box  
Lives a tiny little creature--  
The monster who eats socks

It may eat just one  
Or it may eat a pair  
Sometimes just a toe  
Is all it will dare  
To ingest and digest  
For supper or lunch  
Or maybe a special  
Saturday brunch

So clever and sly  
So timid and shy  
As quick as a fox  
The monster who eats socks.

# The Mud Monster

The darkening skies warn of impeding danger
With lightening and thunder announcing the stranger  
Darting about behind clouds holding back rain  
Waiting for just the right moment to appear once again  
Then, as the raindrops fall to the ground  
As if by magic the monster seems all around  
First a puddle or two where the ground is so bare  
Then like a lake or an ocean almost everywhere  
Ready to glob onto goulashes and boots  
To catch a ride as into homes we scoot  
Appearing from nowhere upon the kitchen floor  
Upon the throw rug leading by the front door  
Up the stairs it follows me now  
Into my room  
...Mud Monster how?  
How do you come so oozy and wet  
Find a good place to become hardened and set  
Show the whole world just where I've gone  
Through puddles and fields on my way home  
Oh, Mud Monster you're such a pain  
I'm glad you only come when it rains.

# The Dragon of Mount Rainier

The last great dragon  
of the world  
Lives on Mount Rainier

And though it's slept  
a long long time  
It will soon wake, I fear

The dragon is long  
tall, and wide  
with tough scales, bright green

And every story  
I've heard of him  
say he is cruel and quite mean

The dragon, its said  
killed a thousand men  
and dragged them to his cave

Ate a hundred  
right then and there  
piled the rest of to save

# The Eaters

I was upstairs playing in my room.  
It was a normal gloomy afternoon.

From down the stairs, came a strange sound.  
That started quiet, but soon grew loud.

A rasping, a scraping, a chewing.  
I thought, what down there is my family doing?

I was concerned, so downstairs I went.  
The noise was coming from the basement.

Down there I found the source of the sound.  
It wasn't my family, they weren't even around.

Instead a huge head, like nothing I've seen.  
Was chomping away at our washing machine!

The head was made of steel and dust.  
It was ten feet tall and covered in rust.

With metal teeth and a powerful jaw.  
Just floating as it munched - no body at all.

# Baby Creep


There's this thing that will creep while your babies asleep  
And it will slink right into their bed.

And quick as a wink. What are you baby still sleeps.
This creep gobbles it up toes to head.  

This will come with a surprise, but your babies quite fine.  
And will continue on sleeping soundly

While the creep stays in the crib under blankets and bib  
and starts to transform quite profoundly.

It's tail shrinks to a stub its beak A nose nub.  
Soft goes it's scaly lizard hide.

I know it sounds wild but it sure will look like your child.  
With the real baby still stuck inside.

With its new style the creep waits awhile.  
Making sure everything's perfect and neat.

And then it will cry out for you with a grin  
because to him a mother's a tasty treat.
